# Secret-Stash
This application will allow users to generate a password between 8-128 characters long abiding by specific criteria. 

The application is quite simple and to the point there are not many added features but it will get the job done.
To begin you are asked to stay inside the parameters set for character length and then from there you have the freedom to choose the style of password you would like.
